# Solar Flares Forecasting

Solar flares are astronomical phenomena where there are localized eruptions of electromagnetic radiation in Sun’s atmosphere. When absorbed by the earth’s atmosphere, the radiation can disrupt satellite communications and reduce their lifetime. Accurately predicting the flare activity beforehand can help us better prepare for such disturbances. Additionally, it can provide more insights into other associated solar features and similar electromagnetic events occurring on other stars in the universe. Over the years, NASA’s RHESSI mission has been monitoring solar flares and recording their characteristics in a dataset. In this project, this dataset is analysed to explore the underlying patterns and trends. Furthermore, autoregressive machine learning models (ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX) and neural network models (LSTM, TCN) are trained on the data to forecast monthly number of solar flares and their average duration. A comparative analysis is done between the models using RMSE as the performance metric. The results obtained show that neural network models were able to perform significantly better than autoregressive models for this data. LSTM and TCN both had similar performance with a little difference in their RMSE values, LSTM having a slight edge over TCN.
